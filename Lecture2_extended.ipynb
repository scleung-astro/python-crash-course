    "In Lecture 1, we have touched on the concept of a list, which is an object. This is an important and flexible data structure that has extremely wide use. There are other important data structures we will not have time to explore the fundamental use of, for example, `dict`, `tuple`, and `set`. These will be useful for data science use or the development of software beyond mathematics. \n",
    "\n",
    "In Python, when we construct a list, we are creating a list *object* to work on. To declare a list object, we type\n",

    "It suffices to observe two features in a Python list. (Notice: the exact properties of a (linked) list depend on the language. For example, the linked list in Java does not necessarily have all the attributes that a Python linked list has.)\n",
    "\n",
    "1. A list can contain from zero to literally infinitely amount of elements upon definition\n",
    "2. A list does not necessarily contain a single data type; we can use it to store different data. \n",

    "\n",
    "If a list can contain different data types, you might wonder if a list can contain some elements that are themselves list objects, then we are forming a multi-dimensional array (aka matrix). The answer is yes and no. **Yes**, because if we look at the data stored, that final object indeed looks like a matrix. **No**, because there is no correspondence between many matrix operations and operations for nested lists. What's worse is that, in terms of computation efficiency, lists are slow. This is because it allocates memory dynamically and therefore does not aim at storing data efficiently to begin with. You may continue to extend the size of each row or column element. Numpy arrays assume a fixed size, so memory access can be done much more efficiently. Unless we only use a list once and for all, we encourage you to use Numpy arrays when your main operations are matrix manipulation. \n",

Therefore, mastering basic operations in Numpy can help us appreciate the more advanced operations in these libraries. \n",
