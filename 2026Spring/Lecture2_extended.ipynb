    "In Lecture 1 we have touched the concept of a list, which is an object. This is an important and flexible data structure which has extremely wide use.

    "If a list can contain different data type, you might wonder if some elements of a list can be list objects, then we are forming literally a multi-dimensional array (aka matrix). The answer is yes and no. **Yes** is that by means of data stored, that final object indeed looks like a matrix. **No** is that there is no correspondence to many matrix operations for a nested list. What's worse is that in terms of computation efficiency, list operations are slow. This is because it uses a dynamic memory allocation approach, and therefore does not aim at storing data efficiently to begin with. You may continue to extend the size of each row or column element. **Numpy arrays** have a fixed size, so memory access is much more efficienct. Unless we only use the list once and for all, we encourage you to use Numpy array when your main operation is matrix manipulation. \n",
