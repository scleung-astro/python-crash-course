    "**Instruction**: In each exercise, go through the guidance and learn/review about the numerical skills that are useful for solving physics problems. Complete the programming exercise where you find the instruction **write you code here** and **write your answer here**. For the code, it means write the Python code according to the instruction. You may directly run the code and see if you generate the correct results. Then send the completed Jupyter Notebook file when you have finished. For the answer, it encourages you to **think** without using the computer. Then write down what you think to be the answer there. In most cases the questions encourage you to think about the answer first. It is an important procedure because having a code designed mentally can greatly speed up your coding accuracy and speed. Most importantly, don't copy and paste the code result to the answer! I will not grade the part in **write your answer**. I only want to give a space for you to think as if you are a Python interpretor. \n",

    "Programming has never become so important nowadays. While the problems we solve are not directly related to very front-end skills like web design or machine learning, the way of thinking, how variables and data are managed and processed and the way to instruct the computer, are similar. \n",

    "I strongly encourage you to think and train the algorithmic thinking. I believe there are almost countless solution available on ChatGPT or StackOverflow if you search, but the clue to build a programming mind is to solve the puzzles by yourself. "

    "Python is an interpreting language. Therefore it does not require the users to compile the code. Instead, Python \"interprets\" your code directly. One advantage is that the development time is very short. However, interpreted language is generally running slower and thus the code is better for building prototype or test model, rather than for doing large-scale operation runs. \n",
    "\n",
    "The very major differences in Python compared to other traditional languages come in 3 ways. (1) It does not require the declaration of variable. In this sense it is very similar to Javascript. You can casually declare `x=1` and Python will automatically recognize *x* is an integer variable and is storing the value 1. (2) Python inherently has the list and dictionary structure which can be readily used. These two flexible data structures are very important and widely applied data type in building complex algorithm. (3) There are essentially every libraries freely available in doing all sorts of computational tasks one can imagine. From building webpage, to maintaining server databse, or even building apps and machine learning, there are corresponding libraries. \n",

Using the above example, `for i in range(5)` generates a list (we wil discuss in much more detail in next talk the properties of a list), containing `[0, 1, 2, 3, 4]`, and it passes 0 as the value of `i`, then runs your operation.

For convenience, we also prefer them as global. For example, it can be the size of your simulation box $nx \\times ny \\times nz$.
