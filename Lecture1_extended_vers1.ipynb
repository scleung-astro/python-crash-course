    "### Keywords continue and break\n",
    "\n",
    "The last thing about basic iteration and condition is the use of `continue` and `break`. They provide special path way inside an iteration to terminate or skip certain part of the iteration. The difference between the two keywords are the following:\n",
    "\n",
    "`continue`: it returns to the beginning of the loop and takes the next number from the \"range\" bag\n",
    "`break`: it terminates the entire iteration\n",
    "\n",
    "The simplest example is that we have a very large loop, but we turn out to only need the first ten of it:\n",
    "```\n",
    "for i in range(100):\n",
    "    if i >= 10:\n",
    "        break\n",
    "```\n",
    "When `i == 10`, it satisfies the `if`-statement, thus the for-loop is terminated. \n",
    "\n",
    "Another example is that we have a large loop, but we need to sum only the odd number case. For even number case if we don't want the loop to do anything.\n",
    "```\n",
    "for i in range(100):\n",
    "    if i%2 == 0:\n",
    "        continue\n",
    "    xxx\n",
    "```\n",
    "When `i` is an even number, it satisfies the `if`-statement, thus it will go back to the beginning of the loop and take the next element to resume the iteration. It will not reach 'xxx'. "
