# python-crash-course
Introductory Python bootcamp class for students in SUNY Poly

Developed in Jan 2023 for specifically students Differential Equation Class.
Updated in 2024, 2025, 2026. 

Each class is about two hours long held in the first two weeks. The course 
assumes no prior background in programming. But students are expected to have 
installed Anaconda platform and the Jupyter-Notebook package for practicing 
the material presented in this course. 

The course contains 4 parts:
1. Introduction, data type, control statement
2. List, Numpy array, functions
3. Scipy, Numpy and MatPlotLib
4. Simple Data analysis and Machine Learning

The 2026 version and onwards contains new datafile for praticing machine learning.
1. penguins.csv: A csv file containing the beaker size of penguins for classification
2. regression_data.txt: A simple two column data (x,y) for regression practice

The pdf version is also available on my homepage

**How to start?**
The exercise note is built on Jupyter notebook. To open and run these notebooks, you will need to do the following step.
1. Visit https://www.anaconda.com/download and download the anaconda (not a snake)
2. Install the Anaconda in your computer. It is large and it takes time so you can do something else when the computer is busy installing. 
3. Visit this Github page to download the material. Go to **2026Spring**, and choose the green button code >> download zip, and then extract the zip file into your Documents or OneDrive/Documents (we found different windows have different setup). Our programming material is stored in the folder Spring2024.
4. Go to Start >> Anaconda Navigator, once you open the app, choose Jupyter-notebook (click the button Launch), then a web interface will be opened in your browser. Use that browser to go to the directory which you extracted in Step 3. 
5. If you cannot find the file, you may use the upload button on the same page and choose the Jupyter-notebook file you extracted in Step 3. Alternatively move the python-crash-course-main folder out of the python-crash-course course folder (which is still the ZIP, so Jupyter does not recognize it). 
6. Enjoy the material and programming!
