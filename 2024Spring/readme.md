This directory stores the Python Crash Course (PCC) tutorial notes.
for 2024 Spring. Many updates are made in this version, which include

1. Redesign the course structure (Set it into two files instead of 3)
2. Added more exercise and challenging problems
3. Extended discussion in NumPy and Matplotlib

The idea is to incorporate the programming skills into relevant courses
including the Numerical Differential Equation (which the prototype note
is built on) and the Intermediate Mechanics. These notes will provide
the necessary foundation for students to quickly pick up the minimum 
skills to explore by themselves in the future.
